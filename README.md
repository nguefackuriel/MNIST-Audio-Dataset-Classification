# MNIST-Audio-Dataset-Classification
In this project, we'll use a classical Machine learning like Decision Tree and a neural Network method like CNN's to classify spoken words from the Audio MNIST dataset. The dataset contains 3000 audio files, where a human pronounces one of ten digits (0-9).

Objectives:

* We convert 3000 MNIST audio files to spectograms.
* We use Tensorflow's API to create a CNN with multiple 2D convolution layers.
* The network prove excellent at classifying the spectograms in 10 distinct classes. 
* Final validation accuracy is about 98%.
